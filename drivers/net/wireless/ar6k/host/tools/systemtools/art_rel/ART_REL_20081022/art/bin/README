/* This README is work-in-progress.

Updated on 2/19/2008 
====================================
- Get the ART release package from <package>/host/tools/systemtools/art_rel.
- Unzip the ART_REL_<date>.tar.gz, e.g.
  tar zxvf ART_REL_<date>.tar.gz
- cd ART_REL_<date>/art/bin
- source mercury_env_bash (or mercury_env_csh)
- run art, e.g.
  ./art.out \\remote=sdio \\id=6041

Notes: 
1. If ART host target interface is not eth1 by default, set environment variable NETIF,
   e.g. setenv NETIF eth2
   Refer to mercury_env_bash(csh).
2. To set a different crytal clock (from the default 26MHz), set environment variable XTALFREQ,
   e.g. setenv XTALFREQ 19200000
   Refer to mercury_env_bash(csh).
2a. To unset a crytal freq
   e.g. unsetenv XTALFREQ 19200000
3. Loading target is no longer required. It's called when ART starts up.
   (Obsolete: load the target,
    ./loadTgt.sh ) 
   Note: if sudo fails, you may need to add your username to /etc/sudoers.
4. Unloading target is no longer required. It's called when ART exits.
   (Obsolete: unload the target,
    ./unloadTgt.sh )


How to run XP version
=====================
- Unzip the package, win_release_<data>.zip, using WinZip to a directory (e.g. win_release_<date>).
- cd win_release_<date>/art/bin
- run ART, e.g.
  art \remote=sdio \id=6041

Notes:
1. Various configurations are set in dkdownload.sh (for Mercury 2.0/2.1, use dkdownload2.sh), 
e.g. ref_clock_19p2.bin for 19.2MHz, and uncomment
out the line #$BMILOADER -w -a 0x500478 -f ref_clock.bin.


How to build Linux ART from the packaged source code
====================================================
- Locate the released package directory, e.g. AR6kSDK.build_sw.27, 
  cd host/tools/systemtools
- Build the customer release,
  ./makeART_customer.sh
- The executables are in the following directories:
  art.out from art/Linux_cust, and 
  libdevlib.so from devlib/Linux_cust.
- Replace the above two files in the official ART release with the newly built ones.


How to build XP ART from the packaged source code
=================================================
- XP ART is built using Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0.
- Locate the released package directory, e.g. AR6kSDK.build_sw.27. 
- In Visual C++, open workspace art_rel.dsw in the released package directory,
  AR6kSDK.build_sw.27\host\tools\systemtools\art
- Build the XP customer release by selecting from the menu,
  Build\Rebuild All
- The executables are in the following directories:
  art.exe from art\customerRel
  devlib.dll from devlib\customerRel.
- Replace the above two files in the official ART release with the newly built ones.
