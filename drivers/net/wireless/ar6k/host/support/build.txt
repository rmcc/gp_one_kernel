It is assumed that you have a Linux/x86 build machine with Fedora
Core 3 (kernel 2.6.9-1.667) sources installed. ISO images available
at /trees/etna/images/fedora_core_3. Kernel source rpm is available
at /trees/etna/fedora-rpms/kernel-2.6.9-1.667.src.rpm. You need to
have a target machine running the kernel 2.6.9-1.667. The build and
the target machine can be same. Your build machine should also have 
Perforce client software.

0) Create a directory, "WORKAREA" and a Perforce client, "P4CLIENT".
   We use Perforce mapping capabilities to allow us to keep related
   files in one location in the source tree, and yet move them to
   where they need to be in order to build.  Refer to p4client.sample
   in this directory for a sample client file that sets things up
   properly.

1) Build the host driver. Go to the etna/host directory and type:
      	make
   This will create the kernel module ar6000.ko. It then recursively
   descends into the 'tools' and 'tests' directory to build all the
   applications. It also creates a driver directory where all the
   driver modules are moved subsequently.

2) Execute the 'loadAR6000.sh' file to insert the driver into the
   kernel. If the WORKAREA environment variable is populated correctly,
   the script shall pick up the modules from the 'driver' directory
   created in step 1 and insert them into the kernel

3) Execute the 'download.sh' script to download the application over
   bmi.
