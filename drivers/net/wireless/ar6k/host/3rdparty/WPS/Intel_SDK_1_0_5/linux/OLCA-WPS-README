The code contained in this package is used to run Client 
(Enrollee) functionality. The following scenarios are currently supported:

(1) Adding an Enrollee to AP+Registrar
(2) Adding an Enrollee with external wired Registrar(ETH)
(3) Adding an Enrollee with external wireless Registrar(WiFi)

Building the WSC code
---------------------
You will need to be root to run the application.
Note: Lines prefixed with '#' indicate commands that are to be run.

1. # cd host\3rdparty\WPS\Intel_SDK_1_0_5\linux
2. The application can be built in either debug or release modes.
   To build the debug version:
   # make
   To build the release version:
   # make BLDTYPE=release
   Note: You may have to download and install latest version of OpenSSL.
         Please follow the directions in the next section.
3. Successful completion of the build process should result in creation 
   of the executable "wsccmd".
4. Copy the configuration files wsc_config.txt.* to the same 
   directory as wsccmd.


Instructions to update OpenSSL
------------------------------
- Download OpenSSL 0.9.8a or latest from http://www.openssl.org/
- Build and Install new OpenSSL
	- ./config --prefix=/usr/local --openssldir=/usr/local/openssl
	- make
	- make test
	- make install
- Remove old OpenSSL include files
	- rm -rf /usr/include/openssl
	- OR (mv /usr/include/openssl /usr/include/old-openssl)


Running the WSC command-line application (wsccmd)
-----------------------------------------------------
To run the application:
# ./wsccmd -i eth2 2>wscapp.log
or
# ./wsccmd 2>wscapp.log
If -i option is not given, by default it will use eth1.
The application generates trace messages for debugging purposes, and this
will cause all such messages to be written out to file wscapp.log. 

Similarly supplicant also generates trace messages for debugging purposes,
which can be found in supplicant.log file, generated in the same directory.


Running the Scenarios
---------------------

(1) Adding an Enrollee to AP+Registrar (EAP)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [AP+Registrar]<----EAP--->[Client]

-  Start wsccmd on both [AP+Registrar] and [Client].
-  [AP+Registrar] Select ("PBC") or ("PIN")
-  [AP+Registrar] Enter enrollee's PIN when prompted. If PIN method selected.
-  [Client] Select ("PBC") or ("PIN")
-  The registration process will begin, and the application will display
   the result of the process on completion.

   If the registration is successful, wpa_supplicant on the client will
   be re-configured with the new parameters, and will connect to the AP
   with these new parameters.

(2) Adding an Enrollee with external wired Registrar (UPnP(ETH)/EAP)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [Registrar]<----UPnP--->[AP]<---EAP--->[Client]

-  Make sure that AP and Registrar are connected through ethernet and pings.
-  Start wsccmd on [Registrar], [AP] and [Client].
-  [Registrar] Select ("PBC") or ("PIN")
-  [Registrar] Enter enrollee's PIN when prompted. If PIN method selected.
-  [AP] Nothing to be selected.
-  [Client] Select ("PBC") or ("PIN")
-  The registration process will begin, and the application will display
   the result of the process on completion.

   If the registration is successful, wpa_supplicant on the client will
   be re-configured with the new parameters, and will connect to the AP
   with these new parameters.

(3) Adding an Enrollee with external wireless Registrar (UPnP(WiFi)/EAP)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [Registrar]<----UPnP--->[AP]<---EAP--->[Client]

-  Make sure that AP and Registrar are connected through Wi-Fi and pings.
-  Start wsccmd on [Registrar], [AP] and [Client].
-  [Registrar] Select ("PBC") or ("PIN")
-  [Registrar] Enter enrollee's PIN when prompted. If PIN method selected.
-  [AP] Nothing to be selected.
-  [Client] Select ("PBC") or ("PIN")
-  The registration process will begin, and the application will display
   the result of the process on completion.

   If the registration is successful, wpa_supplicant on the client will
   be re-configured with the new parameters, and will connect to the AP
   with these new parameters.
