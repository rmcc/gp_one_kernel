The code contained in this package is used to run the Registrar, 
Access Point (as Enrollee or with Registrar capabilities), and Client 
(Enrollee) functionality. The following scenarios are currently 
supported:

1. Initial Access Point (AP) setup, with the Registrar configuring the Access 
   Point
    - One WiFi-enabled laptop is setup as the AP acting as an Enrollee
    - Another WiFi-enabled laptop is setup as a station acting as the 
      Registrar
    - Two subcases are 1a) using EAP transport and 1b) using UPnP transport

2. Configuration of a WiFi client, using an AP with a built-in registrar
    - One WiFi-enabled laptop is setup as the AP with registrar functionality
    - Another WiFi-enabled laptop is setup as a station acting as an 
      Enrollee
  
3. Configuration of a WiFi client using an external registrar. AP acts as a
   proxy and communicates with the client over EAP and with the Registrar
   over UPnP.
    - One WiFi-enabled laptop is setup as a station acting as an Enrollee
    - Second WiFi-enabled laptop is setup as the AP with proxy functionality
    - Third laptop is setup as the registrar. The registrar and the AP are
      connected over ethernet. 

4. Configuration of a WiFi client when two registrars are present, one 
   external and the other built-in to the AP. User chooses the registrar to
   be used.
    - One WiFi-enabled laptop is setup as a station acting as an Enrollee
    - Second WiFi-enabled laptop is setup as the AP with proxy functionality
      and built-in registrar functionality
    - Third laptop is setup as the registrar. The registrar and the AP
      communicate via UPnP over a pre-established IP connection.

Note:  A new file named revision_history is included at the top level of the
       build tree.  This file contains a list of changes made to source files
       since the Beta 3.1d release (the list may not be comprehensive, but it
       will hopefully be useful nevertheless).

Push Button Configuration (PBC)
-------------------------------
A subset of the Push Button Configuration method has been implemented in this
release. SetSelectedRegistrar functionality in the Beacon has been added, and
the registration protocol processes the all-zero PIN, but the PBC
related timeouts (Walk time, Monitor time) are not implemented.


Using new WSC Information Elements (IEs) in 802.11 messages
-----------------------------------------------------------


Hardware and Software Requirements
----------------------------------
The software required on the machines in addition to the WSC code is:
1. Standalone Registrar / Client (Enrollee)
    - OS: Linux Fedora Core 4, kernel version 2.6.11-1.1369_FC4
    - wpa_supplicant, version 0.4.8 plus Intel mods
    - If support for WSC_IE feature is needed (this is the case for all Registrar
          scenarios now), use MadWiFi Atheros driver (madwifi-ng) with patch found 
          in ticket #517 and additional Intel changes.  First apply the patch and
          then add the Intel changes by replacing files with those included in 
          madwifi-ng-1497-changes_Intel_1_0_5.tar.gz.

2. Access Point (Enrollee) / AP with built-in or External Registrar
    - OS: Linux Fedora Core 4, kernel version 2.6.22-1.1369_FC4
    - MadWiFi Atheros driver (madwifi-ng).  Apply patch found in ticket #517(New IOCTL 
          interface to allow application to pass IE to be sent in Management frames). 
          Then add Intel changes by replacing files with those included in 
          madwifi-ng-1497-changes_Intel_1_0_5.tar.gz.
    - hostapd, version 0.4.8 plus Intel mods

We have done our development and testing with version 1497 of the madwifi-ng
branch.

The new WSC IE feature has been tested with an updated MadWifi driver from
Atheros on both the Client and the AP.

Known issues and limitations
----------------------------
1. This software is beta quality, and is not fully tested. Therefore it is not
   100% stable and may have security vulnerabilities related to implementation
   issues.

2. This software is based up on version 1.0h of the Simple Config spec, but 
   it has a few differences.  
   - The UFD feature does not support reading/writing Encrypted Settings files.
   - Only one enrollee device can be added at a time.  The state machines of the 
     Registrar and AP will not correctly handle multiple concurrent registration
     sessions.
   - The PBC method does not implement the timeouts related to detecting multiple
     concurrent sessions.
   - The AP mode does not forward probe requests to external Registrars as UPnP events.
   - Fragmentation and re-assembly of the EAP messages has not been implemented.
 
3. On the Registrar and AP/Registrar-configured devices, if an incorrect PIN is
   entered, the protocol will fail with an EAP-Fail message, as it is supposed 
   to. However, the WSC State Machine does not get not notified of this EAP 
   failure, and the app will therefore not exit its "wait" state, and will 
   continue to wait for a response from the underlying EAP layer. The app may
   be terminated with a "Ctrl-C". Please also remember to terminate the 
   hostapd and wpa_supplicant applications before running wsccmd again.  

4. To enable the USB flash drive options, the variable USB_KEY=1 must 
   be set in the wsc_config.txt file.  By default, this variable is set to 0.


Building the WSC code
---------------------
The build process is common for all the different modes that a particular 
device may be configured as. You will need to be root to run the application.

Note: Lines prefixed with '#' indicate commands that are to be run.

1. Unzip WscRefImpl_Intel_1_x_x.tar.gz to a local directory.
    # tar -xzvf WscRefImpl_Intel_1_x_x.tar.gz
    - This will result in a directory WscRefImpl_Intel_1_x_x to be created, 
      with the code contained within.
2. # cd WscRefImpl_Intel_1_x_x/src/linux
3. The application can be built in either debug or release modes.
   To build the debug version:
   # make
   To build the release version:
   # make BLDTYPE=release
   Note: You may have to download and install latest version of OpenSSL.
         Please follow the directions in the next section.
4. Successful completion of the build process should result in creation of the
   executable "wsccmd" in src/linux.
5. Copy the configuration file to src/linux. This file needs to be in the same 
   directory as wsccmd. Depending on the mode the device needs to be in
   (AP, Client, Registrar, AP with Registrar), one of the pre-set config files
   may be copied over.
    # cp ../common/wsc_config_xxx.txt wsc_config.txt


Instructions to update OpenSSL
------------------------------
These instructions are specifically for RedHat Fedora Core 4 OS.

- Download OpenSSL 0.9.8a from http://www.openssl.org/
- Build and Install new OpenSSL
	- ./config --prefix=/usr/local --openssldir=/usr/local/openssl
	- make
	- make test
	- make install
- Remove old OpenSSL include files
	- rm -rf /usr/include/openssl
	- OR (mv /usr/include/openssl /usr/include/old-openssl)


Steps to integrate Intel modifications to wpa_supplicant and build it
---------------------------------------------------------------------
- Make sure that you have two archive files in the same folder
	1) Original wpa_supplicant - wpa_supplicant-0.4.8.tar.gz
	2) Intel modifications - wpa_supplicant-0.4.8_Intel_1_x_x.tar.gz
- Unzip original 0.4.8 wpa_supplicant. This should create a folder 
  wpa_supplicant-0.4.8 and unzip all the files and folders in it.
	# tar xvfz wpa_supplicant-0.4.8.tar.gz
- Unzip Intel modifications. This should overwrite a few files in
  wpa_supplicant-0.4.8 folder and create a few new files as well.
	# tar xvfz wpa_supplicant-0.4.8_Intel_1_x_x.tar.gz
- See README_WSC for the list of new and modified files.
- Change directory to wpa_supplicant-0.4.8 and copy defconfig file 
  to .config file.
- Do a 'make clean' and 'make' and it should produce wpa_supplicant
  and wpa_cli executables with Intel modifications for WSC Reference 
  Implementation.
- To enable new WSC IE feature, uncomment CONFIG_WSC_IE in .config and
  rebuild wpa_supplicant.


Steps to integrate Intel modifications to hostapd and build hostapd
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Make sure that you have two archive files in the same folder
	1) Original hostapd - hostpad-0.4.8.tar.gz
	2) Intel modifications - hostapd-0.4.8_Intel_1_x_x.tar.gz
- Unzip original 0.4.8 hostapd. This should create a folder hostapd-0.4.8
  and unzip all the files and folders in it.
	# tar xvfz hostapd-0.4.8.tar.gz
- Unzip Intel modifications. This should overwrite a few files in
  hostapd-0.4.8 folder and create a few new files as well.
	# tar xvfz hostapd-0.4.8_Intel_1_x_x.tar.gz
- See README_WSC for the list of new and modified files.
- Change directory to hostapd-0.4.8 and copy defconfig file to .config file.
- Do a 'make clean' and 'make' and it should produce hostapd executable
  with Intel modifications for WSC Reference Implementation.
- To enable new WSC IE feature, uncomment CONFIG_WSC_IE in .config and
  rebuild hostapd.

Preparing the Registrar/Client
------------------------------
1. If you don't have the latest IPW2200 driver/firmware on the PC, download
   from http://ipw2200.sourceforge.net and install them. Alternatively, the
   Madwifi driver can be used.
2. Build wpa_supplicant with Intel modifications. Please see the section on
   building wpa_supplicant in this document.
3. Once wpa_supplicant is built, create softlinks to wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli
   in src/linux (or wherever you will be running wsccmd from). If
   /wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant is the path to those executables:
    # ln -s /wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant wpa_supplicant
    # ln -s /wpa_supplicant/wpa_cli wpa_cli

Preparing the Access Point
--------------------------
1. Make sure you have downloaded a recent version of madWiFi driver and
   installed it correctly on your PC that has Atheros chipset based WLAN card.
2. Build hostapd  with Intel modifications. Please see the section on
   building hostapd in this document.
3. Once hostapd is built, create a softlink to hostapd in src/linux, or wherever
   you will be running wsccmd from. If /hostapd/hostapd is the path to that
   executable:
    # ln -s /hostapd/hostapd hostapd
4. Copy template.conf and hostapd.eap_user from the hostapd directory to
   src/linux. 


Running the WSC command-line application (wsccmd)
-----------------------------------------------------
The WSC command-line application (wsccmd) uses a configuration file called
wsc_config.txt. This config file must be in the same directory as wsccmd.
The config file has a number of parameters that can be changed depending
on the desired mode of operation. Sample config files are provided for 
all the scenarios mentioned above. 

To run the application:
# ./wsccmd 2> wscapp.log
The application generates trace messages for debugging purposes, and this
will cause all such messages to be written out to file wscapp.log. This
file can be examined in real-time by running "tail -f wscapp.log" in 
a separate console.

Similarly supplicant also generates trace messages for debugging purposes,
which can be found in supplicant.log file, generated in the same directory.

Follow the prompts after the application is run. If the application fails 
in its startup process, examine the trace file (wscapp.log) for errors.

Once all required information is entered, the Registration process will start
and the UI will indicate success/failure of the operation when complete.


Running the Scenarios
---------------------
For each of the scenarios, sample configuration files are mentioned below.
These files must be renamed/copied to wsc_config.txt before running the
wsccmd application.

Each scenario can be run in four different ways.

i)   M2 : The enrollee's PIN is provided to the Registrar prior to initiating 
     the registration protocol. The registrar will send an M2 message when M1 
     is received from the enrollee.
ii)  M2D : The registrar is not provided with the enrollee's PIN prior to 
     initiating the registration protocol. The Registrar will send an M2D 
     message when it receives an M1 from the enrollee, and then prompt the user
     to enter a PIN for this enrollee. Once the PIN is entered, the registrar 
     will respond with an M2 the next time the enrollee sends an M1 message.
iii) PBC (Push Button) : A single option is chosen on both the registrar and
     the enrollee, and the registration process is initiated with an
     all-zero PIN.
iv)  UFD (PIN transfer via USB Flash Drive) : Prior to the registration 
     protocol being initiated, the PIN must first be 
     written out to the USB drive using one of the menu options. The code now
     supports both Enrollee PIN and Registrar PIN as well as unencrypted 
     settings on the UFD.  Once the PIN has been written on one side and read
     on the other, the protocol can be initiated through the command menu.


(1a) Initial AP setup, with the Registrar configuring the AP (EAP)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [Unconfigured AP]<----EAP--->[Registrar]

1. [Unconf AP] Use wsc_config_1a_ap.txt.
   Note: To use UFD for PIN transfer, set USB_KEY=1 in the configuration file.  The
   AP's PIN can be passed to the Registrar using the UFD.
2. [Registrar] Use wsc_config_1a_reg.txt.
   Note: To use UFD for PIN transfer, set USB_KEY=1 in the configuration file.
3. Start wsccmd on both [Unconf AP] and [Registrar].
4. Depending on the desired mode of operation, follow one of the options
   below.

(i) M2
-  [Unconf AP] Select option 1 ("Get configured").
-  [Registrar] Select option 1 ("Configure AP").
-  [Registrar] Enter enrollee's PIN when prompted. Also enter the new SSID 
   for the AP when prompted.

   the result of the process on completion.

(ii) M2D
-  [Unconf AP] Select option 1 ("Get configured").
-  [Registrar] Select option 1 ("Configure AP").
-  [Registrar] When prompted for the enrollee's PIN, hit <Enter> to simulate 
   not knowing the PIN. Enter the new SSID for the AP when prompted. 
-  The registration process will start. The Registrar will send an M2D to the
   enrollee on receipt of an M1 and then prompt the user for the enrollee's 
   PIN.
-  [Registrar] Enter the enrollee's PIN
-  The registration process will continue, and the application will display
   the result of the process on completion.

(iii) PBC
-  [Unconf AP] Select option 2 ("Get configured via push-button").
-  [Registrar] Select option 2 ("Configure AP with push-button").
-  The registration process will start, and the application will display
   the result of the process on completion.

(iv) UFD
-  [Unconf AP] Select option 4 ("Write PIN to USB key").
-  [Unconf AP] When prompted, insert the USB key. The PIN will be written
   out.

   the device.
-  [Unconf AP] Select option 1 ("Get configured").
-  [Registrar] Selection option 1 ("Configure AP").
-  [Registrar] Enter the new SSID for the AP when prompted.
-  The registration process will begin, and the application will display
   the result of the process on completion.


5. If the registration is successful, hostapd on the AP will be restarted
   with the newly configured parameters. On the registrar, wpa_supplicant
   will be re-configured with the new parameters, and will connect to the
   AP with these new parameters.
6. The WPA-PSK psk will be written out to the AP and registrar config files.


(1b) Initial AP setup, with the Registrar configuring the AP (UPnP)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [Unconfigured AP]<----UPnP--->[Registrar]

1. [Unconf AP] Use wsc_config_1b_ap.txt.
   Note: To use UFD for PIN transfer, set USB_KEY=1 in the configuration file.
2. [Registrar] Use wsc_config_1b_reg.txt.
   Note: To use UFD for PIN transfer, set USB_KEY=1 in the configuration file.
3. Start wsccmd on both [Unconf AP] and [Registrar].
4. Depending on the desired mode of operation, follow one of the options
   as noted in scenario (1a) above. Note that the selection on the registrar
   needs to be made first, before selecting the correct option on the AP/
   client menu. 
   Also note that in this scenario, wpa_supplicant will not be started on 
   the registrar - other than that, the sequence of events will be similar 
   to those described in 1a.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   [Registrar]<----UPnP--->[AP+Registrar]<---EAP--->[Client]

1. [Registrar] Use wsc_config_4a_reg.txt.
   Note: To use UFD for PIN transfer, set USB_KEY=1 in the configuration file.
   Note: The WPA_PSK value in the [Registrar] config file must match the 
   WPA-PSK value in the [AP+Registrar] config file.
2. [AP+Registrar] Use wsc_config_4a_ap.txt.
   Note: To use UFD for PIN transfer, set USB_KEY=1 in the configuration file.
3. [Client] Use wsc_config_4a_cli.txt.
   Note: To use UFD for PIN transfer, set USB_KEY=1 in the configuration file.
4. Start wsccmd on [Registrar], [AP+Registrar] and [Client].
5. Depending on the desired mode of operation, follow one of the options
   below.

(4a1) Choose external registrar [Registrar] as the registrar to run the 
      protocol with

(i) M2
-  [Registrar] Select option 4 ("Configure Client").
-  [Registrar] Enter enrollee's PIN when prompted.
-  [AP+Registrar] Select option 1 ("Configure Client").
-  [AP+Registrar] When prompted for the enrollee's PIN, hit <Enter> to simulate 
   not knowing the PIN. 
-  [Client] Select option 1 ("Get configured").
-  The registration process will begin, and the application will display
   the result of the process on completion.

(ii) M2D
-  [Registrar] Select option 4 ("Configure Client").
-  [Registrar] When prompted for the enrollee's PIN, hit <Enter> to simulate 
   not knowing the PIN. 
-  [AP+Registrar] Select option 1 ("Configure Client").
-  [AP+Registrar] When prompted for the enrollee's PIN, hit <Enter> to simulate 
   not knowing the PIN. 
-  [Client] Select option 1 ("Get configured").
-  The registration process will start. Both [Registrar] and [AP+Registrar]
   will send M2Ds to the enrollee on receipt of an M1 and then prompt the user 
   for the enrollee's PIN.
-  [Registrar] Enter the enrollee's PIN
-  The registration process will continue, and the application will display
   the result of the process on completion.

(iii) PBC
-  [Registrar] Select option 5 ("Configure Client with push-button").
-  [AP+Registrar] Select option 1 ("Configure Client").
-  [AP+Registrar] When prompted for the enrollee's PIN, hit <Enter> to simulate 
   not knowing the PIN. 
-  [Client] Select option 2 ("Get configured via push-button").
-  The registration process will start, and the application will display
   the result of the process on completion.

(iv) UFD
-  [Client] Select option 3 ("Write PIN to USB key").
-  [Client] When prompted, insert the USB key. The PIN will be written
   out.
-  [Registrar] Select option 6 ("Read PIN from USB key").
-  [Registrar] When prompted, insert the USB key. The PIN will be read from
   the device.
-  [Registrar] Select option 4 ("Configure client").
-  [AP+Registrar] Select option 1 ("Configure Client").
-  [AP+Registrar] When prompted for the enrollee's PIN, hit <Enter> to simulate 
   not knowing the PIN. 
-  [Client] Select option 1 ("Get configured").
-  The registration process will begin, and application will display
   the result of the process on completion.

The unencrypted settings and Registrar-specified PIN modes may also work in this
mode, but we have not actually tested this.

6. If the registration is successful, wpa_supplicant on the client will
   be re-configured with the new parameters, and will connect to the AP
   with these new parameters.


(4a2) Choose AP with built-in registrar [AP+Registrar] as the registrar to run 
     the protocol with

(i) M2
-  [Registrar] Select option 4 ("Configure Client").
-  [Registrar] When prompted for the enrollee's PIN, hit <Enter> to simulate 
   not knowing the PIN. 
-  [AP+Registrar] Select option 1 ("Configure Client").
-  [AP+Registrar] Enter enrollee's PIN when prompted.
-  [Client] Select option 1 ("Get configured").
-  The registration process will begin, and the application will display
   the result of the process on completion.

(ii) M2D
-  [Registrar] Select option 4 ("Configure Client").
-  [Registrar] When prompted for the enrollee's PIN, hit <Enter> to simulate 
   not knowing the PIN. 
-  [AP+Registrar] Select option 1 ("Configure Client").
-  [AP+Registrar] When prompted for the enrollee's PIN, hit <Enter> to simulate 
   not knowing the PIN. 
-  [Client] Select option 1 ("Get configured").
-  The registration process will start. Both [Registrar] and [AP+Registrar]
   will send M2Ds to the enrollee on receipt of an M1 and then prompt the user 
   for the enrollee's PIN.
-  [AP+Registrar] Enter the enrollee's PIN
-  The registration process will continue, and the application will display
   the result of the process on completion.

(iii) PBC
-  [Registrar] Select option 1 ("Configure Client").
-  [Registrar] When prompted for the enrollee's PIN, hit <Enter> to simulate 
   not knowing the PIN. 
-  [AP+Registrar] Select option 5 ("Configure Client with push-button").
-  [Client] Select option 2 ("Get configured via push-button").
-  The registration process will start, and the application will display
   the result of the process on completion.

(iv) UFD
-  [Client] Select option 3 ("Write PIN to USB key").
-  [Client] When prompted, insert the USB key. The PIN will be written
   out.
-  [AP+Registrar] Select option 3 ("Read PIN from USB key").
