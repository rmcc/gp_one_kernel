	help
	  This is common code for AR9170 based devices.
	  This module does nothing by itself - the USB/(SPI) frontends
	  also need to be enabled in order to support any devices.

	  Say Y if you have the hardware, or M to build a module called
	  ar9170common.

config AR9170_USB
	tristate "Atheros AR9170 USB support"
	depends on AR9170_COMMON && USB
	select FW_LOADER
	help
	  This is a driver for the Atheros "otus" 802.11n USB devices.

	  These devices require additional firmware (2 files).
	  For now, these files can be downloaded from here:
	  http://wireless.kernel.org/en/users/Drivers/ar9170

	  If you choose to build a module, it'll be called ar9170usb.

config AR9170_LEDS
	bool
	depends on AR9170_COMMON && MAC80211_LEDS && (LEDS_CLASS = y || LEDS_CLASS = AR9170_COMMON)
	default y
