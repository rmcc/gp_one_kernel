Description:
		A collection of both global and individual CPU attributes

		Individual CPU attributes are contained in subdirectories
		named by the kernel's logical CPU number, e.g.:

		/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu#/


What:		/sys/devices/system/cpu/kernel_max
		/sys/devices/system/cpu/offline
		/sys/devices/system/cpu/online

Description:	CPU topology files that describe kernel limits related to
		hotplug. Briefly:

		kernel_max: the maximum cpu index allowed by the kernel
		configuration.

		offline: cpus that are not online because they have been
		HOTPLUGGED off or exceed the limit of cpus allowed by the
		kernel configuration (kernel_max above).

		online: cpus that are online and being scheduled.

		possible: cpus that have been allocated resources and can be
		brought online if they are present.

		present: cpus that have been identified as being present in
		the system.

		See Documentation/cputopology.txt for more information.


What:      /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cache/index*/cache_disable_X
Date:      August 2008
KernelVersion:	2.6.27
Contact:	mark.langsdorf@amd.com
Description:	These files exist in every cpu's cache index directories.
		There are currently 2 cache_disable_# files in each
		directory.  Reading from these files on a supported
		processor will return that cache disable index value
		for that processor and node.  Writing to one of these
		files will cause the specificed cache index to be disabled.

		Currently, only AMD Family 10h Processors support cache index
		disable, and only for their L3 caches.  See the BIOS and
		Kernel Developer's Guide at
		http://www.amd.com/us-en/assets/content_type/white_papers_and_tech_docs/31116-Public-GH-BKDG_3.20_2-4-09.pdf
		for formatting information and other details on the
		cache index disable.
